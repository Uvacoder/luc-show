    </li>
</ul>

<!--
Web 1.0 started off fairly simple,

The goal was to transfer documents

Bob wanted to send things to alice, and vice versa

The http spec was first introduced, and bob and alice had a great time

Until they kinda both got annoyed at the incongruency between their posts and they decided to use html to have a uniform way to share documents.

Oh and it came with nice "hyper" "links" aswell, if you get what I am saying.

after some time css, and JS joined the picture, and people started using this document sharing things for things it wasnt intended to do.

<!--
Web 2.0: The central focus was around two things,

firstly user-generated content,

Your uncle bob could now, "send you a message" over the world-wide-web :omg:

And secondary, an api-driven world, a world where, everything would talk to everything.

Your bank, could talk to your mom, who could talk to your smart home, which could talk to your bank, etc etc, you get the drill.

This internet highway would be like the female brain, everything is connected to everything -bzz-.

That is a reference to the tale of two brains, if you have seen that, good watch, would recommend.

And then later we realized that letting ur neighbor karne talk to other neighbor karens might nave not been the best idea. But oh well.

Decentralized,

so, no servers

And the people get control over the data

Yes, data is public usually public, but thats better then on some companies computer with who knows what other data they might have collected because you once up on a time clicked the close on the cookie banner.

The whole idea of the backend.... Are being replaced by smart-contracts, that run on miners, and are open source

The database, that was previously on a server in a datacenter somewhere behind lock and key, is now the public (write-only) blockchain, and data is stored in messages attached to 0-value transactions. (explaination for another time, but yeah)

CDN's or "Edge Servers" like ..., gets superseded by the IPFS, a system that stores data on every computer involved.

And for the frontend, with our beloved react, vue, angular, svelte, etc.

Haha, you thought I was getting rid of angular didnt you? Nah, the frontend stays mostly the same, the way we interface with our api's is just slightly different.
