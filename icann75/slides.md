good morning icann75
my name is luc van kampen

the internet is evolving every single day.
in the web3 space 
shift from username password authentication, to public key authentication.
the provable technologies we use today, that power https, ssl, pgp, dnssec, and many more,
can now be used for user authentication.
with this, the days of passwords, password leaks, mass account hacks, and name stealing are over.

Using public key authentication users simply have a private key, and sign messages in order to perform actions.
Authentication, posting a message, and more, are simply authorized using the private key, and allow us to get explicit user confirmation.

With this, users public-keys are now their identity accross the web, and although this system is works very well from a security and machine perspective, it lacks human-readability.

This is where ENS comes in. ENS aims to integrate with the existing DNS, and allows users to. 

in contrary to other systems that might be out ther we are focused on integrating and extending the DNS
we want to work with icann to build a better internet.

we want to coorperate and integrate with the internet community.

all registration fees go to the DAO and are invested into the ecoystem with the aim to improve the internet as whole.

// In 1998 ICANN was founded with the aim to scale and bring a multi-stakeholder approach to the IANA namespace.
// To decentralize it, and allow for the chaos that would become the internet, and to manage the DNS.

// I came here to talk to you today about ENS, the Ethereum Name Service, (a set of programs / a decentralized autonomous organization) with the aim to extend the functionality of the IANA namespace and the DNS system as we know it.

// ENS adds functionality ontop of existing domains in the DNS (*provided they support DNSSEC),
// aswell as implements a smart contract registrar to allow for decentralized domain registration and recordkeeping.

// In addition to all of the above, the ENS is governed by a DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, meaning that governing decisions are made and voted on by the community, and those involved, in a similar policy-making pattern to ICANN, with working groups, proposals, and transparency.

looking forward to working together.
