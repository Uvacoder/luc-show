## web3-auth ([slides](https://luc.show/web3-auth/))

In our modern day and age, two-factor authentication has become the defacto standard for mosts sites these days. Wether it is signing up with your phone number, email-login-links or in-app push notifications.

As we have seen this shift I have become more and more fascinated with fully passwordless authentication, plug-and-play. While exploring the different passwordless authentication the web3 approach using public-key encryption and your ethereum wallet peaked my interest. In the session I run through web3 authentication, the history of the web, public-key authentication, and how to get it working in react.

This presentation was given during a [passionatepeople](https://passionatepeople.io) lunch & learn session.

In this recording I attempt to explain blockchain in relation to a familiar tool for developers, git. By the end of it you should be familiar with the basics of blockchain and the implementation of smart contracts.
